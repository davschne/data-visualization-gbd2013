#Prevalence of Overweight and Obesity in 2013

This interactive data visualization shows prevalence of overweight and obesity in 188 countries, 21 regions, and seven super-regions for the year 2013.

It seeks primarily to address the question, how do different regions and countries compare in prevalence of overweight and obesity?

The data used here is taken from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), coordinated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). The results of this study were published in _The Lancet_ in May 2014 in Global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980â€“2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013:
